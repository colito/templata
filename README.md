H1 Developer Notes

H2 2014-01-31:

H3 16:00 :
* Implemented automated relative pathing for navigation links.
* This currently works best with one level deep directories
* Will need to restructure the program a bit in order to make this work for multi level deep directories
* Thus far as it stands, the key to achieving this is to require the config file within new pages and remove it from files that will be required right after in order to avoid getting error 500

H3 17:05 :
* Implemented restructuring and thus far seems to have been a success.
* Still under careful observation.
