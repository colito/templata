Dunamis - On Site Source Code Manager

Purpose:
Allows user to make changes to their site's sources code regardless of what language the source is written in.


How to get started out:
* Once you have down loaded the zip file of the project, unzip it and edit the config.php file.
* On this file you can change the username and password you'd like to use for logging into Dunamis
* Save changes and ftp the unzipped folder to your host server within the same directory as your website files


This is what it can do so far:
* Browse the file system in which it has been stored
* Open and expose readable files
* Re-write files as long as write permissions for the current user are enabled
* Create a new file within an existing directory using a file path
* Run shell commands (limited)


Issues that still need sorting out:
* None noted as yet


Objectives to be achieved in future:
* Create session timeout
* Ability to change file permissions and/or change the apache user
* Globalize links for easy file referencing from within the system
* Create a database login option on set up
* Prevent files with none editable code from being opened
* Get the back option of file explorer to work effectively as expected
* Make different parts of the Current file path displayed on File explorer clickable
* Add a footer that sticks to the bottom
* Neatly organize project file system without at all hindering functionality
* Establish functionality for creating directories and files anywhere within the file system being managed
* Establish ability to view all possible information of the selected file
* Make files on file explorer highlightable on hover over
* Make tool fully responsive
* Create files necessary for installation
* Find a way to make the tool updatable
